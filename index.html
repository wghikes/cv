        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>At a young age, I was instinctively curious how things worked. Much to my mother's dismay, I'd dissasemble items around the house attempting to understand how they worked and then reassemble them. This grew into a natural gravitation to
          computers and the technologies that made them run. My father was truely amazed one night when, after three hours, a technician couldn't get a memory module to work in his $3000 workstation but after he left, I got it working in 20 mins.
          This was the early 80's when things weren't plug and play. It was then that I knew computer and coding was the thing for me. I had a natural talent to understand how computers and its technology operated and I had a desire to make them run
          better. Over time, I have gained a wealth of information into all aspects of technology and have used that wisdom wisely. Web Development is just one important passion of mine.</p>

        <h3>Spirit Challenge</h3>
        <p>No. I'm not talking about ghosts and poltergeists. I started my quest in making my own alcohol by first learning to brew my own beer. At first it was just a hobby that became an obsession in creating a perfectly unique type of micro-brew.
          However, as times changed my preferences changed as well. I became interested in what gave each type of alcohol it attributes and in so doing I began experimenting in infusing flavors into custom liquors. I still make some alcohol not for
          human consumption but mainly for propulsion and combustion. <color: yellow>üòÅ</color>

        <h3>Backpacking</h3>
        <p>
          Among other interests, I revel in spending time in the outdoors not just recreationally but maintaining the many
          local, state and national trail systems. I've volunteered as a cartographer, read and interpreted map coordinates, helped
          maintain park corridors (park boundaries), and helped build natural stone steps and bridges from local boulders using sledgehammers
          wedges and impact drills.<br><br>
          Our municipal, county, state and national parks are a treasure that we need to appreciate and protect because, once they're gone
          they'll never come back. Help support your local and national parks.
